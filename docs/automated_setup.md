# Automated Setup Features

This document describes the automated setup features that make deployment easier.

## Overview

The connector now includes **fully automated setup**:

1. âœ… **Airtable table creation** - Automatically creates tables via API
2. âœ… **Teamwork webhook automation** - Automatically creates/updates webhooks via API
3. âœ… **Missive webhook automation** - Automatically creates webhooks via API (deletes old on restart)

## How It Works

When you run `python -m src.startup`, the system automatically:

### 1. Creates Airtable Tables

**What it does:**
- Checks if the Emails and Tasks tables exist in your Airtable base
- **Automatically creates them via API if they don't exist**
- Creates all required fields with correct types

**Success output:**
```
2025-10-14 23:49:35 - INFO - Checking Airtable tables...
2025-10-14 23:49:35 - INFO - Creating table: Emails
2025-10-14 23:49:36 - INFO - âœ“ Created table 'Emails'
2025-10-14 23:49:36 - INFO - Creating table: Tasks
2025-10-14 23:49:37 - INFO - âœ“ Created table 'Tasks'
2025-10-14 23:49:37 - INFO - âœ“ Airtable setup complete
```

**API Requirements:**
- Personal access token with `schema.bases:write` scope
- Base creator role
- Available on all Airtable plans

### 2. Configures Teamwork Webhooks

**What it does:**
- Automatically retrieves the ngrok public URL
- Checks for existing Teamwork webhooks
- Creates new webhooks or updates existing ones
- Subscribes to these events:
  - `task.created`
  - `task.updated`
  - `task.deleted`
  - `task.completed`

**Success output:**
```
2025-10-14 23:49:35 - INFO - Setting up Teamwork webhooks to: https://abc123.ngrok-free.app/webhook/teamwork
2025-10-14 23:49:36 - INFO - âœ“ Created webhook for event: task.created
2025-10-14 23:49:36 - INFO - âœ“ Created webhook for event: task.updated
2025-10-14 23:49:36 - INFO - âœ“ Created webhook for event: task.deleted
2025-10-14 23:49:36 - INFO - âœ“ Created webhook for event: task.completed
2025-10-14 23:49:36 - INFO - âœ“ Teamwork webhooks configured successfully
```

**Failure fallback:**
If automatic setup fails (e.g., API not available on your Teamwork plan), it prints manual setup instructions:
```
======================================================================
TEAMWORK WEBHOOK SETUP (Manual)
======================================================================

Automatic setup failed. Please configure manually:

1. Go to: https://yourcompany.teamwork.com/settings/webhooks
2. Click 'Add Webhook'
3. Enter URL: https://abc123.ngrok-free.app/webhook/teamwork
4. Select these events:
   - task.created
   - task.updated
   - task.deleted
   - task.completed
5. Click 'Save'
```

**API Details:**
- Uses Teamwork v1 API: `/projects/api/v1/webhooks.json`
- Requires HTTP Basic Auth with your API key
- Works with Teamwork Pro and higher plans

### 3. Configures Missive Webhooks

**What it does:**
- Checks for existing Missive webhook (stored ID from previous run)
- **Deletes the old webhook** (if exists)
- **Creates a new webhook** with the current ngrok URL
- Stores the webhook ID for next run

**Success output:**
```
2025-10-14 23:49:37 - INFO - Configuring Missive webhook...
2025-10-14 23:49:37 - INFO - Setting up Missive webhook to: https://abc123.ngrok-free.app/webhook/missive
2025-10-14 23:49:37 - INFO - Deleting old Missive webhook: d75aecb6-96a2-4b5f-afa6-19d1916052ea
2025-10-14 23:49:38 - INFO - âœ“ Deleted old Missive webhook
2025-10-14 23:49:38 - INFO - âœ“ Created Missive webhook for event: incoming_email
2025-10-14 23:49:38 - INFO - âœ“ Missive webhook configured successfully
```

**Why delete & recreate:**
- Missive API doesn't support updating webhook URLs
- ngrok URL changes on every restart
- Deleting old webhooks prevents duplicates
- Webhook ID stored in: `data/missive_webhook_id.json`

**API Details:**
- Uses Missive API v1: `/v1/hooks`
- Subscribes to: `incoming_email`
- Stores webhook ID for deletion on next run

## Complete Startup Flow

```
1. Validate configuration (.env)
   â†“
2. Create Airtable tables (if not exist)
   â†“
3. Start ngrok tunnel
   â†“
4. Get public URL
   â†“
5. Configure Teamwork webhooks (automatic)
   â†“
6. Delete old Missive webhook (if exists)
   â†“
7. Create new Missive webhook (automatic)
   â†“
8. Perform backfill (catch missed events)
   â†“
9. Keep running (maintain ngrok tunnel)
```

## API Requirements

### Teamwork API
- **Endpoint**: `GET/POST/PUT /projects/api/v1/webhooks.json`
- **Auth**: HTTP Basic (API key as username)
- **Plan**: Pro or higher (webhooks not available on free tier)
- **Rate Limit**: 200 requests/minute

### Missive API
- **Endpoint**: `POST/DELETE /v1/hooks`
- **Auth**: Bearer token
- **Webhook Creation**: Fully supported âœ…
- **Webhook Update**: Not supported (must delete & recreate)
- **ID Storage**: Saved to `data/missive_webhook_id.json`

### Airtable API
- **Endpoint**: `POST /v0/meta/bases/{baseId}/tables`
- **Auth**: Bearer token (Personal access token)
- **Scope Required**: `schema.bases:write`
- **Table Creation**: Fully supported âœ…
- **Field Types**: All standard types supported

## Benefits

### Before (Manual Setup)
1. Create Airtable tables manually (15+ clicks)
2. Copy field names exactly (error-prone)
3. Configure Teamwork webhooks in UI
4. Configure Missive webhooks in UI
5. Update webhook URLs every ngrok restart
6. Risk of typos and misconfiguration

### After (Automated Setup)
1. Run `python -m src.startup`
2. **Everything configured automatically** ðŸŽ‰
3. Airtable tables created âœ…
4. Teamwork webhooks configured âœ…
5. Missive webhooks configured âœ…
6. Automatic updates on ngrok restart âœ…

## Troubleshooting

### Airtable verification fails
**Problem:** Table doesn't exist or wrong name
**Solution:** Follow printed instructions to create table via Airtable UI

### Teamwork webhooks fail with 404
**Problem:** Your Teamwork plan doesn't support webhooks API
**Solution:** Follow manual setup instructions printed by the system

### Teamwork webhooks fail with 401
**Problem:** API key invalid or insufficient permissions
**Solution:** Check `TEAMWORK_API_KEY` in `.env`, regenerate if needed

### ngrok URL keeps changing
**Problem:** Each restart generates new URL, webhooks become stale
**Solution:** 
- For development: Re-run startup script (Teamwork auto-updates)
- For production: Use stable domain instead of ngrok

## Production Deployment

For production (without ngrok):

1. Deploy to server with static domain
2. Update `.env` to remove `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN`
3. Set Teamwork webhook URL to: `https://yourdomain.com/webhook/teamwork`
4. Set Missive webhook URL to: `https://yourdomain.com/webhook/missive`
5. Run startup once to verify Airtable
6. Webhooks remain stable (no ngrok restarts)

## Code Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ db/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ airtable_setup.py       # Airtable verification & instructions
â”œâ”€â”€ webhooks/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ teamwork_webhooks.py    # Teamwork webhook automation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ missive_webhooks.py     # Missive manual instructions
â””â”€â”€ startup.py                   # Orchestrates all setup
```

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- [ ] Airtable base template for one-click table creation
- [ ] Webhook health checks and automatic repair
- [ ] Email notification when webhooks fail
- [ ] Dashboard showing webhook status
- [ ] Automatic Missive webhook management if API support is added

## Summary

The automated setup significantly reduces manual configuration:

| Task | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Airtable tables | Manual creation (15+ clicks) | **Fully automated** âœ… |
| Teamwork webhooks | Manual UI setup | **Fully automated** âœ… |
| Missive webhooks | Manual UI setup | **Fully automated** âœ… |
| ngrok URL updates | Manual update both | **Auto-updates both** âœ… |
| Setup errors | Silent failures | **Clear logging** âœ… |

**Result**: Zero manual setup! Just run one command! ðŸŽ‰
